                                <div class="faq-answer" style="max-height: none;"><p>We are committed to data minimization. We collect information by fair and lawful means to provide and improve the Bot's functionality.</p><p><strong>1.1. Information Automatically Collected from Discord:</strong><br>- Discord User, Server, and Channel IDs: We collect your User ID to verify your Patreon subscription and manage access. We collect Server IDs to manage server-specific configurations and authorizations. We store Channel IDs when you configure channel restrictions with the /channel command.</p><p><strong>1.2. Information You and Server Admins Provide:</strong><br>- Ark of Osiris Signup Data: When you use the /ark signup commands, we collect and store your in-game name and link it to your Discord User ID. This information is necessary to create and display public signup lists within your server.<br>- Server Configurations: When an administrator sets up features like the Event Calendar, Ark of Osiris Signups, or Ruins/Altar Reminders, we store the configuration choices for that server (e.g., designated channels, roles, event personalization settings) to ensure the feature functions as requested.<br>- Anonymous Command Usage Data: We log general, non-personally identifiable information about which commands are used (e.g., total /commander uses). This data is used for analytical purposes to understand usage patterns and does not track who used a specific command.</p><p><strong>1.3. Information from Third-Party Services (Patreon):</strong><br>- To verify your subscription, we receive your Discord User ID from Patreon when you link your accounts. We do not receive or store any payment information or other sensitive personal data from Patreon. Patreon's own Privacy Policy governs the data they collect.</p></div>
