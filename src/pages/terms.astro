                                            of the Codex Helper bot requires an active Patreon subscription, managed through
                                            our official Patreon page.<br /><br /><strong>2.2. Verification:</strong> Your
                                            subscription is linked to your Discord account via Patreon. To authorize a Discord
                                            server, a user with an active subscription and appropriate server permissions
                                            must run the /patreon verify command.<br /><br /><strong

                                            server. Key administrative commands, such as server authorization (/patreon verify)
                                            and channel management (/channel), require the user to have Administrator or Manage
                                            Server permissions. You are responsible for the Bot's configuration and use within
                                            any server you manage.<br /><br /><strong>2.4. Age Restriction:</strong> You must
                                            be at least 13 years old to use Discord and, consequently, the Bot. By using the
                                            Bot, you confirm that you meet this age requirement.
