      <h1>Codex Helper Terms of Service</h1>
      <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 6/6/2025</p>

      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Codex Helper</strong> ("the Bot"), a Discord bot
        designed to provide Guides & tools for Rise of Kingdoms. These Terms of
        Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Bot.
      </p>
      <p>
        By inviting, adding, or using the Bot in your Discord server, you agree
        to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may
        not use the Bot.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By accessing or using the Bot, you confirm your acceptance of these
        Terms and agree to be bound by them. If you are using the Bot on behalf
        of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms for that
        organization and representing that you have the authority to bind that
        organization to these Terms.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Access and Use of the Bot</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>2.1. Subscription Requirement:</strong> The
          <strong>Codex Helper</strong> bot requires an active Patreon
          subscription to access its features. Your subscription is tied to your
          individual Patreon account and linked Discord account.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2.2. Permissions:</strong> To function correctly, the Bot
          requires certain permissions within your Discord server, including,
          but not limited to, <strong>Administrator</strong>. You grant the Bot
          these permissions by inviting it to your server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2.3. Server Administration:</strong> The Bot is intended for
          use by Discord server administrators or users with "Manage Server"
          permissions. You are responsible for the Bot's use within any server
          you manage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2.4. Custom Commands:</strong> The Bot allows you to designate
          specific channels for command usage using <code>/channel</code>. You
          are responsible for configuring this feature appropriately to prevent
          spam or misuse in your server.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2.5. Age Restriction:</strong> You must be at least 13 years
          old to use Discord and, consequently, the Bot. By using the Bot, you
          confirm that you meet this age requirement.
        </li>
      </ul>
