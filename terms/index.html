                                    <p><strong>2.1. Subscription Requirement:</strong> Access to the full functionality of the Codex Helper bot requires an active Patreon subscription, managed through our official Patreon page.<br><br>
                                    <strong>2.2. Verification:</strong> Your subscription is linked to your Discord account via Patreon. To authorize a Discord server, a user with an active subscription and appropriate server permissions must run the /patreon verify command.<br><br>
                                    <strong>2.3. Server Permissions:</strong> To function correctly, the Bot requires certain permissions within your Discord server. Key administrative commands, such as server authorization (/patreon verify) and channel management (/channel), require the user to have Administrator or Manage Server permissions. You are responsible for the Bot's configuration and use within any server you manage.<br><br>
                                    <strong>2.4. Age Restriction:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to use Discord and, consequently, the Bot. By using the Bot, you confirm that you meet this age requirement.</p>

This name will be stored and publicly displayed within your Discord server in the signup embed to create team rosters. You are responsible for the information provided by your members.<br><br>
                                    <strong>3.2. Event Calendar and Reminders:</strong> When you set up the Event Calendar or other reminder features (e.g., for Ancient Ruins/Altar), the Bot will create and manage Discord roles for notification purposes.
