    <h1>Codex Helper Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 6/6/2025</p>

    <p>Welcome to <strong>Codex Helper</strong> ("the Bot"), a Discord bot designed to provide Guides & tools for Rise of Kingdoms. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and disclose information when you use the Bot.</p>
    <p>By adding or using the Bot in your Discord server, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect information to provide and improve the Bot's functionality, verify subscriptions, and offer support.</p>

    <h3>1.1. Information Automatically Collected from Discord:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discord User IDs:</strong> We collect the User ID of individuals who add the Bot to servers, use Bot commands, or are linked to a Patreon subscription. This is essential for verifying your Patreon subscription, linking it to your Discord account, and managing per-person access.</li>
        <li><strong>Discord Server IDs:</strong> We collect the Server ID of any Discord server where the Bot is added. This is used to control Bot access based on subscriptions and to manage server-specific configurations (e.g., allowed channels).</li>
        <li><strong>Discord Channel IDs:</strong> When you use the <code>/channel</code> command, we store the IDs of the specific channels you designate for Bot command usage within your server. This ensures commands are restricted to your preferred channels.</li>
        <li><strong>Command Usage Data:</strong> We log general, non-personally identifiable information about which commands are used (e.g., <code>total /codex uses</code>, <code>/pairings</code>, <code>/bundle</code>, <code>/event</code>, <code>/commander</code>, <code>/flag cost</code>, <code>/timer burn</code>, <code>/timer shield</code>, <code>/timer heal</code>, <code>/timer buff</code>). This data is used for analytical purposes to understand usage patterns and improve the Bot, and does not track who used a specific command.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2. Information You Provide Through Bot Commands:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom Timer Data:</strong> If you use commands to track timers (e.g., for KVK buffs, structures, shields, flag costs), the information provided (e.g., timer type, duration, associated server/channel ID, and potentially your User ID if it's a personal timer) may be stored to maintain and manage these timers.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback and Support Messages:</strong> If you send messages in our designated feedback or support channels, or directly interact with the Bot for support, these messages and your User ID may be stored to address your queries and improve our services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3. Information from Third-Party Services (Patreon):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you subscribe to the Bot through Patreon, we receive your Discord User ID from Patreon to verify your active subscription status. We do not receive or store any payment information or sensitive personal data from Patreon. Patreon's own Privacy Policy governs the data they collect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To provide the core functionality of the <strong>Codex Helper</strong> bot, including access to commander data, event guides, bundle info, and custom timers.</li>
        <li>To verify and manage your subscription access through Patreon, ensuring only subscribed users can utilize the Bot in their administered servers.</li>
        <li>To enable server-specific configurations, such as allowing commands only in designated channels.</li>
        <li>To monitor and analyze bot usage patterns to identify areas for improvement, troubleshoot issues, and develop new features.</li>
        <li>To provide user support and respond to feedback or inquiries.</li>
        <li>To enforce our Terms of Service and Discord's Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties for their marketing purposes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We share your Discord User ID with Patreon solely for the purpose of verifying your subscription status.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court order or government agency).</li>
        <li><strong>Aggregated/Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or anonymized data (which cannot be used to identify you) with third parties for research, analytics, or service improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your information only for as long as necessary to provide the Bot's services and for legitimate and essential business purposes, such as maintaining the Bot's performance, making data-driven business decisions, complying with our legal obligations, and resolving disputes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If the Bot is removed from a server, or if your Patreon subscription is cancelled and you no longer use the bot, associated data (like Server IDs, Channel IDs, and non-essential User ID links) will be removed or anonymized within a reasonable timeframe, unless required for legal compliance.</li>
        <li>Custom timer data will be retained as long as the timer is active or for a short period thereafter to allow for recovery, then it will be deleted.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Under data protection laws, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data. These may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> You can request access to the personal data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> You can request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete data we hold about you.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten):</strong> You can request that we delete your personal data. Please note that fulfilling this request may result in the inability to use the Bot's services.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Object:</strong> You can object to the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.</li>
        <li><strong>Right to Restriction:</strong> You can request that we restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances.</li>
    </ul>

We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Your continued use of the Bot after any modifications constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>
